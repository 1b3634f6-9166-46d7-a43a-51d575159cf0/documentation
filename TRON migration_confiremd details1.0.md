### Phase 1

1.	Users transfer TRX (ERC20) to the wallet of exchange.
2.	Exchange produces public key and private key.
3.	Exchange provides address data first for TRON foundation. (The matching relationship between Ethereum address and TRON address) 
4.	TRON foundation makes a manual confirmation of received address data. 

### Phase 2

5.	Exchange transfers TRX (REC20) to validated account of TRON foundation and informs TRON foundation to start account verification.
6.	TRON foundation verifies, receives and records TRX (ERC20) of address provided by exchange.

### Phase 3
    
7.	Based on the address data received in Phase 1 and the transaction records received in Phase 2, an amount of TRX are euqal proportional to the number of TRX（ERC20）received in Stage 2, that will be sent on the TRON Mainnet.
    
### Phase 4  
    
8.  The specific exchange will start migration from TRX (ERC20) to TRX regularly. The process is the same as above.
